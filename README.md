# HamiltonCycle
Finds Hamilton Cycle given vertices

This program is based off of an algorithm from this [PDF](https://github.com/jpdefour/Euler-Theorem/files/2975837/82527738.pdf). I selected the UHC algorithm for this.



If I were to improve upon this, I would have an input file of vertices instead of manually creating vertices.
There is also an issue with finding the "neighbor" listed in the algorithm. This program could be written differently to find the neighbor better :)
Please make pull requests with improvements!
